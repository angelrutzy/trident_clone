A file path specifies the location of a file in a computer's file system structure. They can be used to locate files and web resources, like Media files, such as images , music, and videos.
PATHS AND PATH SEPARATORS
In general, a path is a string of characters which specifies a unique location in a directory or page hierarchy. For file systems, each level in the hierarchy is a directory. Different sections of the path are separated by a path separator, such as a forward slash (/). These different sections represent the separate directories or pages in the hierarchy, as shown below: 

In this file path, the Documents file is inside the ANGEL directory. The ANGEL directory is a subdirectory of the Users directory, which is a subdirectory of the C: directory. File paths are one example of a path. Paths are also an important component of URLs.
URLS AND FILE PATHS
URLs specify the location where data and websites are hosted on the web. URLs and file paths both function similarly and provide the location a computer must go to find a particular resource. However, a major difference is that URLs locate resources which are hosted on the Internet, and file paths locate resources which are stored locally or on a local network.
